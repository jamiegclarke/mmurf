# Does Music Make You Run Faster?

An iOS application that correlates strava and spotify data through a storyboard UI

# Introduction

Running has transformed into a cultural movement. No longer limited to a track, the sport gives individuals freedom to exercise, an identify and with that social fulfilment. With trends like this technology soon follows- tracking, planning, and identifying their exercise all become a runnerâ€™s fundamental. It is apps and services like Strava, Fitbit or Nike Run Club that are allowing runners to streamline, understand and improve their skill. 

Conversely, technology has also made music disposable at our fingertips. Services such as Apple, Spotify and Amazon allow us to stream any song at any time. Individuals often turn to music for motivation during exercise. Music can change mood, focus, and stress levels (Shih, et al., 2009). This poses the question if there is any form of correlation between the two and if so, what is the fighting factor that will allow runners to exploit and push their progress to the next level. This project will investigate, discuss, and create a solution to the overarching question: Can music make you run faster?

The project will answer the question with an iOS application. The core of the program will compare two of the most popular services, Strava running metrics (pace, heart rate, distance) to Spotify listening data (beats per minute, song length). 

# Features

My Story: A colourful tunnel design, where user can view certain stats about their running and listening habits
My Stats: Presents graphical previews of user's correlative data and recommendations for their listening habits
My Routes: Presents strava data about their latest routes

# How To

In order to run the software it must be run on Xcode using the iPhone 11 simulator for optimal use. In addition to this a series of dependencies must be installed.

The Spotify iOS framework must be dragged into the project. It is downloadable from this link: https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk
Version 1.2.2 

Next these dependencies must be installed using embedded package dependency installer.

These are as follows:

Alamofire 4.9.1 https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire
Charts 4.0.2 https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts
StravaSwift 1.0.0 https://github.com/mpclarkson/StravaSwift
SwiftyJSON 5.0.1 https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON
Swift-algorithms 1.0.0 https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms
Swift-numerics 5.0.1 https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics

# Disclaimer

This project was made as my univesity final year project, it is far from perfect and is still in its early stages. It was an academic project which I recieved first class honours for my work. If you have any suggestions on how I can improve this project, or tidy my code, please contact me.
